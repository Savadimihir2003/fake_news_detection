## Introduction
The project involves collecting a dataset of real and fake news articles, preprocessing the data, developing machine learning models, and evaluating their performance. The goal is to build a reliable model to help detect fake news efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes a balanced collection of real and fake news articles sourced from credible databases. The data is preprocessed to remove noise and ensure optimal model performance.

## Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
Feature Extraction: Using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
Model Development: Implementing various machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Web Application: A user-friendly interface for real-time fake news detection.

## Modeling
The project explores several machine learning models:

### Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
### Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful classifier for linear and non-linear data.
### Neural Networks: Deep learning models for more complex patterns in the data.
## Evaluation
The models are evaluated on their ability to accurately classify news articles. Key metrics include:

## Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
## Precision: Correctly identified fake news among all identified as fake.
## Recall: Correctly identified fake news among all actual fake news.
## F1 Score: A balance between precision and recall.
